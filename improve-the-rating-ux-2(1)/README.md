# Improve the Rating UX

# Challenge Description

In this challenge, letâ€™s present each movieâ€™s ratings prominently with a big star and the rating number in the top right hand corner of the movie poster.

## Requirements

- Display each movie rating number within a large yellow `StarIcon` in the top right hand corner of the movie posters
- For movies with no rating, show a dash (-) instead of the number and color the `StarIcon` gray

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: You can use the tailwind classes `text-yellow-500` and `text-gray-500` to help color the star
>
> ðŸ’¡ HINT: You can give the movie rating a null value in movies.json to test the proper display of a movie with no rating

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- TailwindCSS is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)

### Example of Finished App

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
